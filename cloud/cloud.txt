		jk, the hardcover for this book is $60, and there's no paperback

		worth looking at, I think, since the book up there is so freaking expensive


also, I'd still like to consider shaping the word clouds into like restroom sign-style gender markers, tbh

potential collision detection for our word cloud:

	- http://www.pygame.org/project-pylygon-1718-3432.html
		(those two are marked as less great for 2d game purposes, but it's still worthwhile)

		(points @ lib2d, which is the new directioon the project took, but forums seem to think this will be most useful)

useful
