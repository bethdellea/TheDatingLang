Natural language processing has been used to analyze speech and text to find patterns and differences in language use between men and women. This research project expands the scope of such studies to find idiosyncracies in the use of language on the dating website OkCupid. User profiles on OkCupid are scraped and tagged with demographic information, then processed to find intricacies in language use, particularly regarding gender, but potentially with respect to sexual orientation, location, age, and other categories. Language use will be compared with past studies, paying attention to how the use of language changes depending on the gender(s) of a user's prospective partners. Research ongoing, expected wrap Spring 2016.
