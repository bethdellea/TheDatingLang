things we have a control for and can test for in our okc data:
- pronouns in bios (esp msg if)
- adj/adv use
- tense used ?
- avg length per section, overall
- ->word ct and num unique words (per sect & overall)
- length of sentences
- punctuation use
- introspective/emotion and filler words (feel/know/guess)
- action words ?
- passive vs active voice

(need to think for alogrithms for these things, and any prior research to compare to)
